# RecommendMusicToMe

My first MVC application.  

A rather ugly, clunky and quick attempt at a Music recommending program (using Spotify) with fun outcomes.

Based on this assignment:
Your assignment is to build an application that recommends music to the user. The application should in some way ask for input regarding the users taste in music and the recommendations should be based on the user's input. Ideally, it should also be possible to adjust the recommendations by, for instance, allowing the user to change their input or by allowing them to add more information once they can see the initial recommendations. It is completely up to you which questions you wish to ask the user, and how you want the user to provide their input. Examples of inputs to ask for are year/decade, genre, an artist, a song etc.
Requirements
Your application should be written in C# and ASP.NET MVC (or .NET Core MVC). It should contain at least two views: one for gathering information and one for showing the recommendations. Our assesment of your assigment will be based on the server-side code and the structure of the code. You should be able to explain and discuss your decisions regarding how you implemented your application.
